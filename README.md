## Overview

Overall, this challenge was relatively easy and fun to do. I had no problems doing the card and other elements, although I did struggle a lot working with the background images. That made me realize I need to practice more "Image Positions" on CSS. 

I'm also having many difficulties getting a grasp of media queries and need to double my efforts on this matter. It's not hard to understand but, for some reason, is making me confused with the min-max properties. 

Thanks for reading this :D
